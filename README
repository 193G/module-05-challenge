# Work Day Scheduler

## USER STORY / Descrption

*in this challenege we have to add java script to add save, date and colour change functions based on past, present, and future plus i added an extra clear functon to clear all the data from the text boxes 

*GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
*WHEN I open the planner
*THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
*WHEN I scroll down
*THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
*WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate *whether it is in the past, present, or future
*WHEN I click into a time block
*THEN I can enter an event
*WHEN I click the save button for that time block
*THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
*WHEN I refresh the page
*THEN the saved events persist
